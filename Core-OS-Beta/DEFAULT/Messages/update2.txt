Hello Core user,

Recently, development on Core OS has once again started up, allowing for us to add small patches here and there to improve your experience.
Small QoL fixes have also been introduced, such as system files and folders now appearing in light cyan instead of being in a jumble with the rest of your personal files.
Tic Tac Toe has additionally been added to the Games folder for an extra little bit of fun every now and then. 
All people in BST time have also had a small fix added, moving forward the time by 1 hour during BST periods. That took me asurprisingly longer amount of time than I thought it would.
We thank you for being so patient whilst we gradually evolve Core.
Please, as always, make sure to report any bugs you have found in the comments, with a screenshot of the error and how it was caused, if you can :)
