Hello Core user,

As many of us have experienced lately, Replit has removed the ability to comment on other people's posts, and run other people's code. Sharing our projects was a big part of this profile, and Replit being as useful and as convenient as it was, was perfect for starting a Development group. Thankfully, our latest release "Core OS" proved a huge success on the platform, and I and the others thank you very much for your wonderful comments and support on the project. 

Where do we go from here?

As much as it pains me to say it, TriTech will have to be disbanded, and progress on any future projects will be completely stopped, or hosted in private as individual projects rather than those for the world to see. Unfortunately the TriTech profile will see no new advancements from other members, and only the profile's leader @Xytrophico will have access to it, reverting it back to an individual profile. It will keep the name of TriTech, and important/large projects or those that performed well will remain on the platform, but other smaller projects will either be made private, and if that isn't possible, deleted from Replit's servers. 

Thank you everyone for your support with the growth of this profile and its projects, and as always, thank you for using Core.
:)
