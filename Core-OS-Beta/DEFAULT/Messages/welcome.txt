Hello Core user! The team at TriTech is proud to announce that we have begun working on another OS!

This shell aims to be understandable and simple to use, 
so that just about anyone can pick it up and learn it in a matter of seconds.

The commands will all be single word, and all be prompt-based after the return key is pressed.
It would be much appreciated if you reported any bugs in the comment section below.
Hope you enjoy using Core!
