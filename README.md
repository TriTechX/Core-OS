# Core-OS
Core OS is a simple CLI Operating System written entirely in Python.

## Please note!
This current version (v1.2.3 Beta) is made entirely for Replit. It may be unstable running locally on your computer. If you're running Core OS on a computer, using Linux terminal to run it is highly recommended, as this is the software used similarly by Replit.
Various functions are either redundant or serve no purpose on Windows.

## Installation:
Find the latest release, and download the ```.zip``` file. 
You may have to install Core OS' dependencies. 
```pip``` is required and ```Python 3.11.8``` is recommended for running this software.

### For Linux:
Type the following to install Core's dependencies.

```console
sudo apt update&&sudo apt install python3-pip
pip install shutil
pip install psutil
pip install pathlib
pip install datetime
pip install colorama
pip install webbrowser
pip install requests
pip install contextlib
pip install io
```

Now, find the ```.zip``` file and extract its contents.
Type ```python3 <directoryofmain.py>/main.py``` to run Core OS.

Always remember to report any issues/bugs in the issues section on Github.
